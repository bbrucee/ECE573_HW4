    "The Bellman-Ford algorithm needs to run at most |V|-1 times to find the shortest path from source to each node. However, if no changes occur after an iteration then we can terminate early. This works because the underlying mechanic in the Bellman-Ford algorithm is that on each iteration we are guarenteeing that the shortest path of length equal to the iteration number is found. In the worst case, a graph with |V| vertices can have a vertex where the shortest path is |V|-1 vertices away from the source. In the above graph, thankfully we avoid the worst case."
